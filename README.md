we first import the necessary libraries such as pandas for data manipulation and seaborn for data visualization. We then load the dataset from the specified URL"[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis]" using pd.read_csv().
To understand the sentiment distribution in the dataset, we print the first few rows of the dataset using data.head(). Next, we calculate the counts of each sentiment category using value_counts() and store it in sentiment_counts.
For visualization, we create a count plot using seaborn's countplot() function to display the distribution of sentiments in the social media data. 
The plot provides a visual representation of the sentiment distribution, making it easier to interpret public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands based on the dataset.
By running this code, we can gain insights into sentiment patterns in social media data, enabling you to make informed decisions based on public sentiment analysis.
